# Black & Scholes modelling for financial Greeks

All the content you will find there come from the Udemy class 'Mathematical Finance with Python'.

I decided to take this course in order to improve my coding on Jupyter Lab, and also because these tools are very useful when dealing with options.

**Black & Scholes modelling : from the B&S mathematical equation, i gave the formula for a Call and a Put**

*N() = cumulative distribution function *T = time left til' maturity (in years)   

- T = time left til' maturity (in years)  

- S = underlying stock price  

- K = strike price  

- r = risk free rate  

- sigma = volatility of the underlying stock  


In the first graph, we can see a relation bewteen S and the call and put values. When S increseas , the Call value increase and the Put value decrease and inversely.*
If we bought a call option with a strike price X at the money or in the money (meaning that at the time of the purchase S = K or S > K), if S increases we make money,* and if we bought the Call out of the money (K>S), same result but we make money when S surpasse K.
